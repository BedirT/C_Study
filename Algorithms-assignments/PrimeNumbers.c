//A number is called almost prime if it has exactly two distinct prime divisors. For
//example, numbers 6, 18, 24 are almost prime, while 4, 8, 9, 42 are not. Find the amount
//of almost prime numbers which are between 1 and n, inclusive.

//Input
//Input contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000).

//Output
//Output the amount of almost prime numbers between 1 and n, inclusive.

//test - input : 10 - output : 2
